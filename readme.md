# Nylas Challenge

## Dependencies & Setup

To get started install the dependencies with

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, you'll need to update `config.json` with your specific credentials.

## Challenge

You'll be using the Nylas Python SDK to perform a few tasks.  You might want to
reference our [Python SDK](https://github.com/nylas/nylas-python/) and our [API
documentation](https://docs.nylas.com) when working on the challenge.

To get started, open `challenge.py` in your preferred editor and follow the
instructions within the file.

Good luck!
